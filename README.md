# React Native TypeScript SQLite App_ xample
A React Native app that lets you store (locally), edit, and delete notes.

The Notes app is a mobile app built with React Native CLI and TypeScript that allows you to create, edit, and delete notes. The app uses SQLite to store notes locally on the device, and provides a simple and intuitive user interface for managing notes.

## Features
* Create new notes with a title and description:</br>

</br>

* Edit existing notes: Click on the note from the list and the note will be loaded to "edit."
* Delete notes:  Click on the note from the list and the note will be loaded to "delete."
* View a list of all notes
* Automatically saves notes locally using SQLite

## Getting Started
To get started with the Notes app, follow these steps:
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install the dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
* Start the app by running npx react-native run-ios or npx react-native run-android in the project directory.
* Use an emulator or a physical device to run the app.

## Technologies Used
* The Notes app is built with the following technologies:
* React Native CLI - A command-line interface for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
* TypeScript - A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to improve code quality and maintainability.
* SQLite - A lightweight relational database that can be used to store data locally on a mobile device.

## Benefits of Using TypeScript
TypeScript offers several benefits over plain JavaScript, including:
* Improved Code Quality: By adding optional static typing, TypeScript can catch type-related errors at compile time rather than at runtime, which can improve the quality and maintainability of the code.
* Enhanced IDE Support: TypeScript provides enhanced IDE support, including autocompletion, refactoring, and error checking, which can help developers write code more efficiently and with fewer errors.
* Easier Collaboration: With TypeScript, developers can define clear interfaces for functions and objects, which can make it easier to collaborate on large projects and maintain code consistency across teams.

## Benefits of Using SQLite
SQLite offers several benefits over other database systems, including:
* Portability: SQLite is a self-contained database that doesn't require a separate server or installation, making it easy to deploy and use on a variety of platforms and devices.
* Lightweight: SQLite is a lightweight database that can be used in environments with limited resources, making it ideal for mobile apps and other embedded systems.
* Relational: SQLite is a relational database that supports SQL, which makes it easy to work with structured data and perform complex queries.
